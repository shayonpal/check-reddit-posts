    "description": "Hello, my fellow addicts!\n\nI have the unhealthy habit of smoking cigarettes and have been trying to quit for some time now. \nTo visualize my progress and motivate myself, I've built this 'Sober Since...' Shortcut that shows how long I've been quitting.\n\n‚≠êÔ∏èFeatures:\n- The Shortcut has two different access modes. The first is achieved by starting the Shortcut from the Shortcut App and the other mode is achieved by starting the Shortcut outside of the Shortcut App.\n- For a quick overview, the Shortcut label is updated every time you start it outside the Shortcuts App or have it updated by an Automation (best run shortly after the time of the beginning of your quitting).\n- You can place and launch the Shortcut as a widget on the home screen or in the control center to get a more detailed view of its progress.\n- Light/- and Darkmode support.\n- It is possible to restart the timer if you have a fallback (the number of attempts is counted up automatically).\n- The timestamps are encoded so that you cannot cheat yourself or others that easily ;)\n- The Shortcut works completely offline and no data ever leaves your device.\n\n‚öôÔ∏èInstallation:\n- To use the Shortcut, you need the App DataJar (https://apps.apple.com/de/app/data-jar/id1453273600) to be able to save values permanently.\n- You need to start the Shortcut from the Shortcut App to perform the initial installation.\n- This way you can also access a menu later to edit your entries if necessary.\n\nüîóShortcuts: \n- Shortcut: https://www.icloud.com/shortcuts/238012c12a8140a4a523db3dab06fcd8 \n- Shortcut for Automation: https://www.icloud.com/shortcuts/8ff2f00e89bc470dbd9a9f7f2021b70c\n\nIf you have any questions, problems or ideas on how to improve the Shortcut, please let me know.\n\nOtherwise, I wish everyone the best of luck to successfully and permanently overcome their addictions and hope that my little Shortcut might help you a little with that :) \nIf you can imagine it, then you can do it!",

    "analysis": "The user is trying to create an Apple Shortcut automation that runs automatically without requiring manual tapping of \"Continue.\" Their automation partially works: when a certain if-statement condition is false, the music starts without issue.

They want to eliminate the need to manually confirm and prevent the timeout error.",
