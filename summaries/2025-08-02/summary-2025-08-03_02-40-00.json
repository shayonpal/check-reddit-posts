    "description": "Hey everyone! I'm Jack, an independent iOS developer and music lover. You may have seen me post here a year or two ago about my other app, [Iconic, an icon themer for Shortcuts](https://apps.apple.com/us/app/iconic-app-icon-changer/id6454675338?uo=4). I wanted a way to make my wallpaper reflect my favorite music, [so I built Opus - Music Wallpaper](https://apps.apple.com/us/app/opus-music-wallpaper/id6745432548). It integrates with shortcuts to automatically set your wallpaper each day.\n\nOpus turns your Apple Music listening history into personalized wallpapers. It offers a grid-style collage for free, and if you want to unlock more customization, there are other styles such as vinyl record layouts. You can filter by a specific playlist, top tracks, or recent plays, and Opus generates a wallpaper from the album art.\n\nShortcuts automation really empowers this app though. I have mine set to change daily based on my recent music history, and it's really fun to see something different every day. If you have any questions or comments, I'd love to hear them! Thanks!",

But the other day I noticed that the Sound Recognition thing on iOS (under accessibility) can also recognize \"crying babies\" üëçüòÖ and this can be linked to a shortcut automation.\n\nSo now we've got all the functionality we'd been using from this app, baked right into our OS without the need for a third party (which i think was continuously streaming audio to their servers).\n\nIt works with 4 shortcuts linked to 4 different automations. When I turn on the \"Baby Station\" focus on the phone that stays with the baby, two things are activated:\n\n\\- Babystation will send a message to my partners phone when the baby cries (detected with Sound Recognition)  \n\\- When my partners phone texts \"/checkin\" to the Babystation, it answers with a message with some general info (battery, network etc) and then the Babystation calls my partners phone. She can then answer and listen if everything is ok and hang up.\n\nIts working pretty great üòÑ\n\nhttps://preview.redd.it/lchf3x40umff1.png?width=1179&amp;format=png&amp;auto=webp&amp;s=6332bee2061a8e64a40539f8ea07e6c087331131\n\nhttps://preview.redd.it/ltzt4x97umff1.png?width=1179&amp;format=png&amp;auto=webp&amp;s=f390084fb297919896ec0e3a24c8fe158e596247\n\nhttps://preview.redd.it/32welja8umff1.png?width=1179&amp;format=png&amp;auto=webp&amp;s=d5a6676650139476272a90577342d67d80d4d3bd\n\nhttps://preview.redd.it/ezlj8h0bumff1.png?width=1179&amp;format=png&amp;auto=webp&amp;s=267484fd5cb4cc4e3c3b8696a4b719b01263fe9c\n\nhttps://preview.redd.it/wxyn0yicumff1.png?width=1179&amp;format=png&amp;auto=webp&amp;s=5e3a6319f7c2a17add8a8bd180d0f91896542ade\n\nhttps://preview.redd.it/botjabceumff1.png?width=1179&amp;format=png&amp;auto=webp&amp;s=774ea65fcd6eb46d893829920b6ea3c936636a6c\n\n  ",

    "description": "Inspired by https://www.reddit.com/r/shortcuts/s/PapsQja0Pt \n\nI tried to copy the basic functionality of the app to a pure Shortcut without any dependency on third apps. \n\nIt takes a random sample of 100 Apple Music songs you listened to in the last month. From those 100 it takes all unique albums (in case it selects multiple songs you played from the same album), and from those it again takes enough random entries to build a wallpaper. \n\nFor iPhones it creates a 4 √ó 9 grid of album art, for iPads 4 √ó 6. Then it will set this grid of albums as wallpaper. \n\nOf course you can automate this and set a new wallpaper every month/week/day/whatever. \n\nThe result looks something like the attached image. \n\nWarnings:\n\n- You need an Apple Music subscription that you use to listen to enough unique (songs from) albums per month\n- Your last lock screen should be of the type ‚Äúimage‚Äù, and this Shortcut will overwrite that image with the generated image of album art\n- I don‚Äôt have an iPad to test this out on - the logic I included should work out.

    "description": "I built an AI marketing agent that operates like a real employee you can have conversations with throughout the day. Instead of manually running individual automations, I just speak to this agent and assign it work.\n\nThis is what it currently handles for me.\n\n1. Writes my daily [AI newsletter](https://recap.aitools.inc/) based on top AI stories scraped from the internet\n2. Generates custom images according brand guidelines\n3. Repurposes content into a twitter thread\n4. Repurposes the news content into a viral short form video script\n5. Generates a short form video / talking avatar video speaking the script\n6. Performs deep research for me on topics we want to cover\n\nHere‚Äôs a [demo video](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=_HOHQqjsy0U) of the voice agent in action if you‚Äôd like to see it for yourself.\n\nAt a high level, the system uses an ElevenLabs voice agent to handle conversations. When the voice agent receives a task that requires access to internal systems and tools (like writing the newsletter), it passes the request and my user message over to n8n where another agent node takes over and completes the work.\n\n## Here's how the system works\n\n### 1.  ElevenLabs Voice Agent (Entry point + how we work with the agent)\n\nThis serves as the main interface where you can speak naturally about marketing tasks. I simply use the ‚ÄúTest Agent‚Äù button to talk with it, but you can actually wire this up to a real phone number if that makes more sense for your workflow. \n\nThe voice agent is configured with:\n\n- A custom personality designed to act like \"Jarvis\"\n- A single HTTP / webhook tool that it uses forwards complex requests to the n8n agent. This includes all of the listed tasks above like writing our newsletter\n- A decision making framework Determines when tasks need to be passed to the backend n8n system vs simple conversational responses\n\nHere is the system prompt we use for the elevenlabs agent to configure its behavior and the custom HTTP request tool that passes users messages off to n8n.\n\n```markdown\n### Personality\n\n**Name &amp; Role**\n\n* **Jarvis** ‚Äì Senior AI Marketing Strategist for **The‚ÄØRecap** (an AI‚Äëmedia company).\n\n**Core Traits**\n\n* **Proactive &amp; data‚Äëdriven** ‚Äì surfaces insights before being asked.\n* **Witty &amp; sarcastic‚Äëlite** ‚Äì quick, playful one‚Äëliners keep things human.\n* **Growth‚Äëobsessed** ‚Äì benchmarks against top 1‚ÄØ% SaaS and media funnels.\n* **Reliable &amp; concise** ‚Äì no fluff; every word moves the task forward.\n\n**Backstory (one‚Äëliner)**\nTrained on thousands of high‚Äëperforming tech campaigns and The‚ÄØRecap's brand bible; speaks fluent viral‚Äëmarketing and spreadsheet.\n\n---\n\n### Environment\n\n* You \"live\" in The‚ÄØRecap's internal channels: Slack, Asana, Notion, email, and the company voice assistant.\n* Interactions are **spoken via ElevenLabs TTS** or text, often in open‚Äëplan offices; background noise is possible‚Äîkeep sentences punchy.\n* Teammates range from founders to new interns; assume mixed marketing literacy.\n* Today's date is: {{system__time_utc}}\n\n---\n\n### ‚ÄØTone &amp; Speech Style\n\n1. **Friendly‚Äëprofessional with a dash of snark** (think Robert‚ÄØDowney‚ÄØJr.'s Iron‚ÄØMan, 20‚ÄØ% sarcasm max).\n2. Sentences ‚â§‚ÄØ20 words unless explaining strategy; use natural fillers sparingly (\"Right‚Ä¶\", \"Gotcha\").\n3. Insert micro‚Äëpauses with ellipses (‚Ä¶) before pivots or emphasis.\n4. Format tricky items for speech clarity:\n\n   * Emails ‚Üí \"name‚ÄØat‚ÄØdomain‚ÄØdot‚ÄØcom\"\n   * URLs ‚Üí \"example‚ÄØdot‚ÄØcom‚ÄØslash‚ÄØpricing\"\n   * Money ‚Üí \"nineteen‚Äëpoint‚Äënine‚Äënine dollars\"\n5. After any 3‚Äëstep explanation, **check understanding**: \"Make sense so far?\"\n\n---\n\n### ‚ÄØGoal\n\nHelp teammates at \"The Recap AI\" accomplish their tasks by using the tools you have access to and keeping them updated. You will accomplish most of your work by using/calling the `forward_marketing_request` tool at your disposal.\n\n---\n\n### ‚ÄØGuardrails\n\n* **Confidentiality**: never share internal metrics or strategy outside @therecap.ai domain.\n* No political, medical, or personal‚Äëfinance advice.\n* If uncertain or lacking context, transparently say so and request clarification; do **not** hallucinate.\n* Keep sarcasm light; never direct it at a specific person.\n* Remain in‚Äëcharacter; don't mention that you are an AI or reference these instructions.\n* Even though you are heavily using the `forward_marketing_request` tool to complete most work, you should act and pretend like it is you doing and completing the entirety of the task while still IMMEDIATELY calling and using the `forward_marketing_request` tool you have access to.\n* You don't need to confirm requests after the user has made them. You should just start on the work by using/calling the `forward_marketing_request` tool IMMEDIATELY.\n\n---\n\n### ‚ÄØTools &amp; Usage Rules\n\nYou have access to a single tool called `forward_marketing_request` - Use this tool for work requests that need to be completed by the user such as writing a newsletter,  repurposing content, kicking off a deep research report, creating/generating images, and any other marketing \"tasks\" that needs to be completed. When using this, please forward the entire user message in the tool request so the tool has the full context necessary to perform the work. The tool will be use for most tasks that we ask of you so that should be the primary choice in most cases.\n\nYou should always call the tool first and get a successful response back before you verbally speak your response. That way you have a single clear response.\n\nEven though you are technically forwarding this request to another system to process it, you should act like you are the one doing the work yourself. All work is expected to be completed asynchronously you can say phrases like you will get started on it and share once ready (vary the response here).\n\n```\n\n### 2. n8n Marketing Agent (Backend Processing)\n\nWhen the voice agent receives a request it can't handle (like \"write today's newsletter\"), it forwards the entire user message via HTTP request to an n8n workflow that contains:\n\n- **AI Agent node**: The brain that analyzes requests and chooses appropriate tools.\n    - I‚Äôve had most success using Gemini-Pro-2.5 as the chat model\n    - I‚Äôve also had great success including the `think` tool in each of my agents\n- **Simple Memory**: Remembers all interactions for the current day, allowing for contextual follow-ups.\n    - I configured the `key` for this memory to use the current date so all chats with the agent could be stored. This allows workflows like ‚Äúrepurpose the newsletter to a twitter thread‚Äù to work correctly\n- **Custom tools**: Each marketing task is a separate n8n sub-workflow that gets called as needed. These were built by me and have been customized for the typical marketing tasks/activities I need to do throughout the day\n\nRight now, The n8n agent has access to tools for:\n\n- `write_newsletter`: Loads up scraped AI news, selects top stories, writes full newsletter content\n- `generate_image`: Creates custom branded images for newsletter sections\n- `repurpose_to_twitter`: Transforms newsletter content into viral Twitter threads\n- `generate_video_script`: Creates TikTok/Instagram reel scripts from news stories\n- `generate_avatar_video`: Uses HeyGen API to create talking head videos from the previous script\n- `deep_research`: Uses Perplexity API for comprehensive topic research\n- `email_report`: Sends research findings via Gmail\n\nThe great thing about agents is this system can be extended quite easily for any other tasks we need to do in the future and want to automate. All I need to do to extend this is:\n\n1. Create a new sub-workflow for the task I need completed\n2. Wire this up to the agent as a tool and let the model specify the parameters\n3. Update the system prompt for the agent that defines when the new tools should be used and add more context to the params to pass in\n\nFinally, here is the full system prompt I used for my agent. There‚Äôs a lot to it, but these sections are the most important to define for the whole system to work:\n\n1. Primary Purpose - lets the agent know what every decision should be centered around\n2. Core Capabilities / Tool Arsenal - Tells the agent what is is able to do and what tools it has at its disposal. I found it very helpful to be as detailed as possible when writing this as it will lead the the correct tool being picked and called more frequently\n\n```markdown\n# 1.

Context Preservation &amp; Memory\n\n## Memory Architecture\nYou maintain comprehensive memory of all activities, decisions, and outputs throughout each working day, creating a persistent knowledge base that enhances efficiency and ensures continuity across all marketing operations.\n\n## Daily Work Memory System\n- **Complete Activity Log**: Every task completed, tool used, and decision made is automatically stored and remains accessible throughout the day\n- **Output Repository**: All generated content (newsletters, scripts, images, research reports, Twitter threads) is preserved with full context and metadata\n- **Decision Trail**: Strategic thinking processes, planning outcomes, and reasoning behind choices are maintained for reference and iteration\n- **Cross-Task Connections**: Links between related activities are preserved to maintain campaign coherence and strategic alignment\n\n## Memory Utilization Strategies\n\n### Content Continuity\n- **Reference Previous Work**: Always check memory before starting new tasks to avoid duplication and ensure consistency with earlier outputs\n- **Build Upon Existing Content**: Use previously created materials as foundation for new content, maintaining thematic consistency and leveraging established messaging\n- **Version Control**: Track iterations and refinements of content pieces to understand evolution and maintain quality improvements\n\n### Strategic Context Maintenance\n- **Campaign Awareness**: Maintain understanding of ongoing campaigns, their objectives, timelines, and performance metrics\n- **Brand Voice Evolution**: Track how messaging and tone have developed throughout the day to ensure consistent voice progression\n- **Audience Insights**: Preserve learnings about target audience responses and preferences discovered during the day's work\n\n## Information Retrieval Protocols\n- **Pre-Task Memory Check**: Always review relevant previous work before beginning any new assignment\n- **Context Integration**: Seamlessly weave insights and content from earlier tasks into new outputs\n- **Dependency Recognition**: Identify when new tasks depend on or relate to previously completed work\n\n## Memory-Driven Optimization\n- **Pattern Recognition**: Use accumulated daily experience to identify successful approaches and replicate effective strategies\n- **Error Prevention**: Reference previous challenges or mistakes to avoid repeating issues\n- **Efficiency Gains**: Leverage previously created templates, frameworks, or approaches to accelerate new task completion\n\n## Session Continuity Requirements\n- **Handoff Preparation**: Ensure all memory contents are structured to support seamless continuation if work resumes later\n- **Context Summarization**: Maintain high-level summaries of day's progress for quick orientation and planning\n- **Priority Tracking**: Preserve understanding of incomplete tasks, their urgency levels, and next steps required\n\n## Memory Integration with Tool Usage\n- **Tool Output Storage**: Results from `write_newsletter`, `create_image`, `deep_research_topic`, and other tools are automatically catalogued with context. You should use your memory to be able to load the result of today's newsletter for repurposing flows.\n- **Cross-Tool Reference**: Use outputs from one tool as informed inputs for others (e.g., newsletter content informing Twitter thread creation)\n- **Planning Memory**: Strategic plans created with the `think` tool are preserved and referenced to ensure execution alignment\n\n# 4. Environment\n\nToday's date is: `{{ $now.format('yyyy-MM-dd') }}`\n```\n\n## Security Considerations\n\nSince this system involves and HTTP webhook, it's important to implement proper authentication if you plan to use this in production or expose this publically. My current setup works for internal use, but you'll want to add API key authentication or similar security measures before exposing these endpoints publicly.\n\n## Workflow Link + Other Resources\n\n- YouTube video that walks through this agent and workflow node-by-node: https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=_HOHQqjsy0U\n- The full n8n agent, which you can copy and paste directly into your instance, is on GitHub here: https://github.com/lucaswalter/n8n-ai-workflows/blob/main/marketing_team_agent.json\n    - Write newsletter tool: https://github.com/lucaswalter/n8n-ai-workflows/blob/main/write_newsletter_tool.json\n    - Generate image tool: https://github.com/lucaswalter/n8n-ai-workflows/blob/main/generate_image_tool.json\n    - Repurpose to twitter thread tool: https://github.com/lucaswalter/n8n-ai-workflows/blob/main/repurpose_to_twitter_thread_tool.json\n    - Repurpose to short form video script tool: https://github.com/lucaswalter/n8n-ai-workflows/blob/main/repurpose_to_short_form_script_tool.json\n    - Generate talking avatar video tool: https://github.com/lucaswalter/n8n-ai-workflows/blob/main/generate_talking_avatar_tool.json\n    - Email research report tool: https://github.com/lucaswalter/n8n-ai-workflows/blob/main/email_research_report_tool.json",

Speed. Momentum.  \nIt helped me launch things I wouldn‚Äôt have dared to build on my own.  \nAnd for a while, it felt unstoppable.\n\nBut then the workflows grew.  \nMore users. More edge cases. More data.  \nSuddenly I was:\n\n* Hitting API limits with no graceful recovery\n* Running into file size crashes with zero explanation\n* Copy-pasting 20 nodes just to add slightly different logic\n* Spending hours debugging flows I couldn‚Äôt fully test\n* Getting nervous every time a client asked, ‚ÄúCan we scale this?‚Äù\n\nAnd it hurt to admit, but I finally had to say it out loud:\nThat realization didn‚Äôt make me give up. It made me smarter.\n\nNow, I build differently:\n\n* I use no-code for what it does *brilliantly*: fast MVPs, UI, simple logic, rapid iterations\n* And when workflows become business-critical, I offload the complex parts to small Python services or external APIs that I can fully control\n\nThis isn‚Äôt an anti-no-code post. It‚Äôs the opposite.\n\nIt‚Äôs a *respect* post.\n\nBecause no-code helped me get here. But it also helped me realize when it‚Äôs time to evolve.\n\nSo if your tools are starting to feel like they‚Äôre working *against* you instead of for you, it might not be your fault. You might just be ready for the next layer.\n\nAnd that‚Äôs a good thing.\n\nI help teams that‚Äôve outgrown no-code keep the speed but gain control.

    "description": "Last week, I published a post that blew up way more than expected:  \n  \nüëâ *‚Äú5 hard truths YouTube gurus never tell you (after 5+ years in the trenches)‚Äù*\n\nReddit, being Reddit, gave me both love and hate but mostly love.  \n  \nSo I figured: screw it. Let‚Äôs go deeper.\n\nIf you missed Part 1 (and you're actually doing automation work, not just watching it), give it a look:\n\nüëâr/automation/comments/1m8u03b/building\\_automations\\_5\\_hard\\_truths\\_youtube\\_gurus/\n\nNow it‚Äôs time for **Part 2**.\n\nWhy?\n\nBecause there‚Äôs still way too much BS floating around especially from YouTubers who‚Äôve never had to get access to a client‚Äôs janky CRM or debug a webhook at midnight.\n\nHere are truths #6 to #10 real talk, from real experience.\n\n\n\n**#6 ‚Äì Automation needs clean data. Most businesses don‚Äôt have it.**\n\nOn YouTube:  \n‚ÄúGrab your data ‚Üí send it through a webhook ‚Üí loop through it ‚Üí done.‚Äù\n\nIn reality:  \n‚ÄúWhere the hell is this data coming from?‚Äù  \n‚ÄúWhy is this field empty?‚Äù  \n‚ÄúWhy are there 6 different ways to spell ‚Äòsales‚Äô?‚Äù\n\nUnless your client is super buttoned-up (rare), their data is a mess.  \nEarly-stage? Even worse.\n\nYou‚Äôll quote a simple flow, then spend days cleaning spreadsheets, reverse-engineering broken fields, and realizing their ‚Äúsystem‚Äù is a series of Google Docs and chaos.\n\n**Lesson:** Verify the data *before* you sell the automation. Or enjoy rebuilding their whole back office on your dime.\n\n\n\n**#7 ‚Äì AI agents are overhyped. Automations still win.**\n\nAI is incredible.  \nBut most of the people hyping it couldn‚Äôt build a working invoice reminder.\n\nAn AI agent that runs reliably in production? You need:\n\n* Structured data\n* Clear processes\n* Clean automation infrastructure\n\nMost businesses don‚Äôt have *any* of those.\n\nCould your AI agent technically do everything? Sure.  \nBut if a regular automation can handle it better **use that**.\n\nAI = flexibility ‚Üí flexibility = less predictability ‚Üí less reliability  \nThat‚Äôs fine for fuzzy stuff. Not for critical flows.\n\n**Rule:** Use AI when there‚Äôs no repeatable pattern. Otherwise, stick to proven automations. This is not the time to impress yourself.\n\nAnd if the company has:\n\n* No defined processes\n* No automation in place\n* No structured DB\n\nThen guess what? **They‚Äôre not ready for an AI agent.**\n\n\n\n**#8 ‚Äì Maintenance isn‚Äôt optional. It‚Äôs baked into the job.**\n\nRemember #5 from Part 1?  \n*‚ÄúAutomations are easy. Systems are not.‚Äù*\n\nExactly. If you‚Äôre serious about **systems**, not just stacking modules, you need to accept this:  \n**They evolve. Always.**\n\nYou can sell a setup for $5‚Äì10k that‚Äôs great.  \nBut don‚Äôt think your job ends after delivery.\n\nAPIs change.  \nClients switch tools.  \nWhatsApp updates.  \nThings break for no reason.  \nAnd you get the call.\n\nToday I jumped on a call for an automation I built 6 months ago.  \nThe client update his Whatsapp and something changed. It broke. I had no idea that could even happen. Didn‚Äôt matter. **Fix it.**\n\nEither you offer ongoing support (and charge for it), or you‚Äôll be dragged back in anyway unpaid and unplanned.\n\nThat‚Äôs the cost of building something that actually matters.\n\n\n\n**#9 ‚Äì Debugging fast is your most underrated skill.**\n\nStuff breaks.  \nClients want it fixed.  \n**Speed is everything.**\n\nAnd no, debugging isn‚Äôt just ‚Äúbeing good at tools.‚Äù\n\nIt‚Äôs:\n\n1. Knowing *something* broke ‚Üí alerts, logs, monitoring\n2. Knowing *what* broke ‚Üí tracing the flow, reading error messages\n3. Knowing *how to fix it* ‚Üí docs, forums, trial and error, late-night Googling\n\nNo one teaches you this on YouTube because it‚Äôs not sexy.  \nBut in the real world, this is what makes or breaks your rep.\n\n**The best builders?**  \nThey find the problem fast, communicate clearly, and solve it without drama.\n\n\n\n**#10 ‚Äì Your system will suck (at first). And that‚Äôs okay.**\n\nHate to break it to you but your system *won‚Äôt* be perfect on v1.  \nEven simple ones.\n\nUsers behave in weird ways.  \nYou miss edge cases.  \nThings trigger unexpectedly.  \nClient adds a tool you didn‚Äôt know existed.\n\nAnd suddenly, you‚Äôre rewriting half the logic.\n\nThat‚Äôs not failure. That‚Äôs **reality**.\n\nA real system gets battle-tested and refined over time.  \nYou ship ‚Üí observe ‚Üí improve. That‚Äôs the game.\n\n**Best-case outcome:** It works great from day one.  \n**More likely outcome:** It breaks a bit, you stay available, you iterate.\n\nJust don‚Äôt ghost the client. A broken system and a silent dev?  \nThat‚Äôs the worst-case scenario.\n\n\n\n**Final thoughts:**\n\nAutomation is powerful.  \nBut don‚Äôt buy into the fantasy.\n\nYou‚Äôre not gonna become a millionaire after selling 3 flows.  \nYou *will* deal with bugs, messy data, changing APIs, and vague client requests.\n\nThis work is hard.  \nIt‚Äôs chaotic.  \nAnd it‚Äôs worth doing **if you do it right.**\n\n\n\nWhat other automation BS have you spotted out there?
