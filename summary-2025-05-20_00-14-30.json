    "description": "Hello, my fellow addicts!\n\nI have the unhealthy habit of smoking cigarettes and have been trying to quit for some time now. \nTo visualize my progress and motivate myself, I've built this 'Sober Since...' Shortcut that shows how long I've been quitting.\n\n‚≠êÔ∏èFeatures:\n- The Shortcut has two different access modes. The first is achieved by starting the Shortcut from the Shortcut App and the other mode is achieved by starting the Shortcut outside of the Shortcut App.\n- For a quick overview, the Shortcut label is updated every time you start it outside the Shortcuts App or have it updated by an Automation (best run shortly after the time of the beginning of your quitting).\n- You can place and launch the Shortcut as a widget on the home screen or in the control center to get a more detailed view of its progress.\n- Light/- and Darkmode support.\n- It is possible to restart the timer if you have a fallback (the number of attempts is counted up automatically).\n- The timestamps are encoded so that you cannot cheat yourself or others that easily ;)\n- The Shortcut works completely offline and no data ever leaves your device.\n\n‚öôÔ∏èInstallation:\n- To use the Shortcut, you need the App DataJar (https://apps.apple.com/de/app/data-jar/id1453273600) to be able to save values permanently.\n- You need to start the Shortcut from the Shortcut App to perform the initial installation.\n- This way you can also access a menu later to edit your entries if necessary.\n\nüîóShortcuts: \n- Shortcut: https://www.icloud.com/shortcuts/238012c12a8140a4a523db3dab06fcd8 \n- Shortcut for Automation: https://www.icloud.com/shortcuts/8ff2f00e89bc470dbd9a9f7f2021b70c\n\nIf you have any questions, problems or ideas on how to improve the Shortcut, please let me know.\n\nOtherwise, I wish everyone the best of luck to successfully and permanently overcome their addictions and hope that my little Shortcut might help you a little with that :) \nIf you can imagine it, then you can do it!",

    "description": "Hello all,\n\nI created an automatic expense tracker for iOS/Mac in India using Shortcuts and Automations. It's a bit clumsy, but it works. Made it because I couldn't find any reliable apps that will automatically track spending in India. Made it for myself, thought I'd share. It's a first attempt, do let me know if it works for you. All credit to ChatGPT for making the regex for parsing SMSes.\n\n* Uses transaction SMSes to add spends to a Notes file.\n* Uses Automations to forward SMSes using some keywords to the Shortcut.\n* The Shortcut parses the message and adds it to the Notes file.\n* Follows a CSV format so that you can later export it to a spreadsheet application to analyse if you'd like. Format is: *date, expense amount, account/card, merchant/recipient, month*. The final 'month' entry is to make things easier with a spreadsheet (eg. using charts or a pivot table to understand expenses better).\n* Each time it tracks an expenditure, it will show a notification showing what it tracked. This can be disabled by deleting that block in the Shortcuts app.\n* **Currently works for:**\n   * *Credit cards*: HDFC, ICICI, Axis, IndusInd, IDFC\n   * *Accounts/UPI*: SBI, HDFC, IndusInd, IDFC\n\n**Pros:**\n\n* Privacy-preserving. All data stays safely encrypted on your device (and iCloud if enabled). No communication with any third-party app or website.\n* Automatic. Tracks SMSes and adds spends automatically. Even if it stops tracking/cannot track merchant name, it will still track amount, date, and which card/account was used.\n* Entirely native. Uses Shortcuts and Notes app present natively on Apple devices. No extra apps to install.\n* Easily analysable. Since it saves in CSV, you can export the Notes file to a spreadsheet to understand your expenses. You can keep it as simple as summing up columns to as fancy as using pivot tables. For eg. [see this tutorial](http://Hello all,   I created an automatic expense tracker for iOS/Mac using the native Shortcuts app. It%27s a bit clumsy, but it works. Made it because I couldn%27t find any reliable apps that will automatically track spending in India.      Uses transaction SMSes to add spends to a Notes file.     Uses Automations to forward SMSes using some keywords to the Shortcut.     The Shortcut parses the message and adds it to the Notes file.     Follows a CSV format so that you can later export it to a spreadsheet application to analyse if you%27d like. Format is: date, expense amount, account/card, merchant/recipient, month. The final %27month%27 entry is to make things easier with a spreadsheet (eg. using charts or a pivot table to understand expenses better).     Each time it tracks an expenditure, it will show a notification showing what it tracked. This can be disabled by deleting that block in the Shortcuts app.\n\n**Cons:**\n\n* While it *might* work for other banks and cards, it currently works only for the banks and cards given above. Not tested on debit cards. If it works for other banks/cards, it will most probably only extract the date, account/card, and amount spend, and *not* the merchant name.**\\***\n* Often, it may not extract the merchant name, just extracts the date, expense amount, account/card, and month.\n* It is based on how transaction SMSes look right now. If that format changes, this will not work. But again, it will most probably extract everything except the merchant name.\n* I'm not a coder, it's rather clumsy right now. It uses multiple nested if-then statements to rule out the kind of bank/card (mostly to identify the merchant). It may not be practical to include every single UPI and card-issuing bank.\n* Might require some manual interventions when the merchant is not tracked or not clear. The notification should alert you to what has been automatically tracked.\n* *Does not* track income, money sent to you, refunds etc. Only tracks expenses.\n* This not a budgeting solution, only an expense tracker. That said, feel free to use it to create your own Shortcuts or spreadsheet to do more advanced budgetting.\n\n**Instructions:**\n\n1. Create a note in the native Notes app titled \"Expense tracker\" before you import the file. First line of the notes file should be: *Date, Amount, From, To, Month*\n2. Import the Shortcut using the icloud link below.\n3. Go through the Shortcut to make sure that it is linked to the Notes file. If it appears in red, click on it, and link it to your note file.\n4. (Please go through the Shortcut if you can to ensure you understand how it works, even if you don't understand the regex.)\n5. Set up 2 Automations on the Shortcuts app (use the *Automation* tab):\n   1. When: Message &gt; Leave sender blank | add Message Contains: *spent* | Select Run Immediately &gt; My Shortcuts &gt; select *Expense tracker*\n   2. When: Message &gt; Leave sender blank | add Message Contains: *debited* | Select Run Immediately &gt; My Shortcuts &gt; select *Expense tracker* [*This is what is should look like*](https://i.postimg.cc/3rm6LNgZ/automations-eg.jpg)\n6. You should be ready to go! Check to see if you get a notification when you spend something the next time saying \"Tracked...\". If not, please report here and send a copy of the transaction message (without personal details)?\n\n**You can find and import the Shortcut here:** [**https://www.icloud.com/shortcuts/b1667c3d112046fba155f9101c5b7759**](https://www.icloud.com/shortcuts/b1667c3d112046fba155f9101c5b7759)\n\n*(v. 1.0 | last updated 16 May, 2025)*\n\n**Looking ahead:**\n\n* I plan to keep this updated as transaction SMS formats change and as I crowdsource other formats.\n* ** If you send me** (DM or paste here) your transaction SMSes from other cards/banks, I will try to add them to this Shortcut. Needless to say, please randomise your account/card number, amount, and date, but try to keep the merchant as-is if you are okay with it.\n\n-----------------\n\nThis is what the Notes file would look like:\n\n`28 Apr 25, 1000.50, Card XX1234, IND*Amazon, Apr`\n\n`28 Apr 25, 2000.00, A/c **5678, Unkown, May`\n\n*(first is a card transaction, second is a UPI transaction but could not track merchant)*",

Zapier‚Äôs pricing, for example, is insane for what it offers. Basic automations that can be handled with a simple Python script hosted on a $10 VPS are costing people hundreds of dollars a year in platform fees.\n\nLike some automations such as regular price monitoring from a supplier‚Äôs site, stock adjustments based on inventory changes, automated invoice generation and emailing\n\nAll of these can be done with a lightweight Python script and a cheap VPS. Lifetime cost? Less than a single yearly plan on Zapier for 10k‚Äì20k runs.\n\nOf course, Zapier and n8n shine when you need massive cross-platform integration with complex workflows‚Äîno argument there. But for small to medium automation? It‚Äôs overkill and expensive.\n\nNext time someone suggests Zapier or n8n, ask a Python or JavaScript developer if it really needs that, or if you‚Äôre just paying for convenience. You might be surprised at the savings.\n\nTL;DR: Zapier is great, but it‚Äôs not always necessary. Many tasks can be automated with Python for a fraction of the cost.",
