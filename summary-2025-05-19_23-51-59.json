    "description": "Hello, my fellow addicts!\n\nI have the unhealthy habit of smoking cigarettes and have been trying to quit for some time now. \nTo visualize my progress and motivate myself, I've built this 'Sober Since...' Shortcut that shows how long I've been quitting.\n\n‚≠êÔ∏èFeatures:\n- The Shortcut has two different access modes. The first is achieved by starting the Shortcut from the Shortcut App and the other mode is achieved by starting the Shortcut outside of the Shortcut App.\n- For a quick overview, the Shortcut label is updated every time you start it outside the Shortcuts App or have it updated by an Automation (best run shortly after the time of the beginning of your quitting).\n- You can place and launch the Shortcut as a widget on the home screen or in the control center to get a more detailed view of its progress.\n- Light/- and Darkmode support.\n- It is possible to restart the timer if you have a fallback (the number of attempts is counted up automatically).\n- The timestamps are encoded so that you cannot cheat yourself or others that easily ;)\n- The Shortcut works completely offline and no data ever leaves your device.\n\n‚öôÔ∏èInstallation:\n- To use the Shortcut, you need the App DataJar (https://apps.apple.com/de/app/data-jar/id1453273600) to be able to save values permanently.\n- You need to start the Shortcut from the Shortcut App to perform the initial installation.\n- This way you can also access a menu later to edit your entries if necessary.\n\nüîóShortcuts: \n- Shortcut: https://www.icloud.com/shortcuts/238012c12a8140a4a523db3dab06fcd8 \n- Shortcut for Automation: https://www.icloud.com/shortcuts/8ff2f00e89bc470dbd9a9f7f2021b70c\n\nIf you have any questions, problems or ideas on how to improve the Shortcut, please let me know.\n\nOtherwise, I wish everyone the best of luck to successfully and permanently overcome their addictions and hope that my little Shortcut might help you a little with that :) \nIf you can imagine it, then you can do it!",

I got tired of making the same folder structure every time a new project came in.\n\nClient onboards ‚Üí create 30+ nested folders ‚Üí share ‚Üí repeat. Every. Single. Time.\n\nAt first, I thought I was just being lazy.  \nBut then I found a bunch of other people online ranting about the same thing.  \nThat‚Äôs when I realized, maybe this ‚Äúboring‚Äù problem was actually worth solving.\n\nSo I built FolderGen, a tool to create folder templates with placeholders like \\[ClientName\\], \\[Date\\], \\[ProjectType\\] etc.  \nWith one click, it spins up a clean folder tree in your Google Drive.  \nNo Zapier. No scripts. No mess.\n\nAnd since Google Drive doesn‚Äôt let you duplicate folder structures natively, this makes the process *so* much easier.\n\nI just put it out there and to my surprise, I have started finding real traction.  \n  \nI know this isn‚Äôt world-changing AI or some massive workflow system but honestly, it's removed one of the most boring recurring tasks I deal with. Not trying to revolutionize the world. Just help people save time and stay organized.\n\nHappy to share how it works or answer questions!  \nAlways open to feedback from the community.",
